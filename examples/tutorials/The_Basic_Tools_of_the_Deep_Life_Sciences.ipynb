        "Welcome to DeepChem's introductory tutorial for the deep life sciences. This series of notebooks is a step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques needed to do deep learning for the life sciences. We'll start from the basics, assuming that you're new to machine learning and the life sciences, and build up a repertoire of tools and techniques that you can use to do meaningful work in the life sciences.\n",

You'll also need to run the following commands to get DeepChem installed on your colab notebook. We are going to use a model based on tensorflow, because of that we've added [tensorflow] to the pip install command to ensure the necessary dependencies are also installed"

This is a very important property in drug development: if a proposed drug isn't soluble enough, you probably won't be able to get enough into the patient's bloodstream to have a therapeutic effect.  The first thing we need is a data set of measured solubilities for real molecules.  One of the core components of DeepChem is MoleculeNet, a diverse collection of chemical and molecular data sets.  For this tutorial, we can use the Delaney solubility data set. The property of solubility in this data set is reported in log(solubility) where solubility is measured in moles/liter."
